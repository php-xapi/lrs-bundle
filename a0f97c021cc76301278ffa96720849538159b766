I think we should add a custom attribute to our route definitions and let the listener terminate early when that attribute is not set to not modify requests not related to the Experience API.

@Lctrs generally that's a very nice approach üëç

For this, I propose to introduce a custom route loader that will support `xapi_lrs` type. It will be in charge of adding the custom attribute on our routes.

I propose the custom attribute to be named `xapi_lrs.route` and will hold a true boolean.

WDYT ?

I think adding a custom loader just for that is overkill. You can just add such an attribute manually to all our routes (just reference them with the `default` option). :+1: for the suggested name by the way.

I just proposed that to be sure we don't forget to add it one day. But it's always an easy fix. I'll add it manually.
