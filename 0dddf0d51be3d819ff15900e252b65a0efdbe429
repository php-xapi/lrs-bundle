> Should we throw a core Symfony exception or an exception from the php-xapi/exception package and implement a custom exception listener that will build the good Response for the exception ?

We should recheck with the spec whether there is some requirement for the format and information we need to provide (I don't think so, but I might be wrong). Throwing exceptions that can directly be converted to the proper responses by Symfony looks like the best solution to me otherwise.

According to this https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI-Spec/blob/master/xAPI-Communication.md#211-put-statements, we are only required to return a Response with a specific status code.

Plus, they only check for the status code in their conformance test suite in https://github.com/adlnet/xAPI_LRS_Test/tree/master/src/features.

@Lctrs Do you plan more changes or should I merge here when the code style has been updated?

Except if you see more test cases, I don't plan more changes. Goal of this PR has been fulfilled. Other topics evoked in this conversation will be the subjects of other PRs.

Looks good to me. I'll merge tonight when I get my hands back on my computer. :)
